        <h1>History Of Fried Rice</h1>
        <p id="Odd">The earliest record of fried rice is found in the Sui dynasty (589–618 CE).Though the stir-frying technique used for fried rice was recorded in a much earlier period, it was only in the late Ming dynasty (1368–1644 CE) that the technique became widely popular.
Fried rice is believed to have started as a way to accommodate leftovers.
 Traditionally, Southern Chinese prefer their rice polished and plain, as a base staple to eat with meat and vegetables.
 The vegetables, meat and rice leftovers from the day before—which have passed their prime but are still good to consume
  and too good to be fed to animals—are seasoned with soy sauce, lard and garlic, and stir-fried, making a hot meal.</p>
  <h1>My opinion on Fried Rice</h1>
  <p class="Even">I enjoy Fried Rice immensely and recommend to all those who are wondering if it is worth it. Fried Rice is found in many places and
      is always a treat to have. The prices for it are low and in most places quality is great. So keeping that in mind I hope you decide
      to try it.
