        <div style="font-size: 25px; background-color: wheat; color: steelblue;">
            <p>Dubai Scholars is a school of prestige and has a very strict discipline policy. All the students that attend are well-behaved
                as compared to other schools. This school is a British School located in Al Quasis, Dubai, UAE. It is also one of the oldest
                schools in the UAE. It was founded in 1976 and has been very successful.
            </p> 
            <p>The school has an emblem that is extremely memorable and is on all students uniforms as seen below. Dubai Scholars is also a
                high standard school and has been rated good by the KHDA over a course of 10 years. The school provides transport to all of

        <p>There are many activities that take pace in my school from studying in the classrooms to experiments in the science labs.
            Some others are: playing sports on the football field, basketball court or the swimming pool. </p> 
        <p>My personal favourite part of the school is the library where we (students are allowed to pick up any one book from the
            hundreds that are there.</p> <br>
