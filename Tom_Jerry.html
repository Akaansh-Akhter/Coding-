        <h2>What is this movie about?</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most beloved rivalries in history is re‐ignited when Jerry moves into New York City’s finest hotel on the eve
             of “the wedding of the century,” forcing the event’s desperate planner to hire Tom to get rid of him. The ensuing cat and
              mouse battle threatens to destroy her career, the wedding and possibly the hotel itself. But soon, an even bigger problem
               arises: a diabolically ambitious staffer conspiring against all three of them. An eye‐popping blend of classic animation
                and live action, Tom and Jerry’s new big‐screen adventure stakes new ground for the iconic characters and forces them to
                 do the unthinkable...work together to save the day.

        <h2>Reviews</h2>
        <p>
            Well, this movie was sort of a swing and a miss. I mean, it is a movie with the title "Tom and Jerry", but it focus more on 
            the human character Kayla (played by Chloë Grace Moretz). So it was somewhat of a disappointing affair to sit through this
             movie.And in all honesty, then a live action movie with animated character drawn into it just didn't work. It just was so
              1990s, and it didn't sit well with my particular preference for a 2021 movie, and definitely not for a Tom and Jerry
               adventure. Nay, Tom and Jerry should be fully animated, as it has always been.
