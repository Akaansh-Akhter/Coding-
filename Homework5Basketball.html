        <h2>History</h2>
        <P>The first professional league was founded in 1898. Six teams took part in the National Basketball League, and the
         first champions were the Trenton Nationals, followed by the New York Wanderers, the Bristol Pile Drivers and the Camden Electrics.
         World basketball was growing, but it was on June 18, 1932 that a real international organization was formed, to coordinate
          tournaments and teams: that day, Argentina, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Portugal, Romania and Switzerland founded
           the International Basketball Federation in Geneva.</P>
