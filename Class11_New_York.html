    <h1>New York</h1>
    <img id="Pageimage" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.7457b28b12d412ae19eb5e18a99d3fbd?rik=enXsm5Mi64ASkQ&pid=ImgRaw&r=0">
    <h2>Population and Size</h2>
    <p>New York State has an overall population density of 421 people per square mile, with an area of 47,126 square miles. When most
     people think of New York, they immediately think of New York City, the largest city in the US. New York City is also the most
      densely populated major city in the country. Nearly 43% of New York state's population live in the 305 square miles that comprise
       New York City.</p>
       <h2>Geography</h2>
       <p>The geography of New York City is characterized by its coastal position at the meeting of the Hudson River and the Atlantic
            Ocean in a naturally sheltered harbor. The city's geography, with its scarce availability of land, is a contributing factor
             in making New York the most densely populated major city in the United States.</p>
    <h2>Culture</h2>
    <p>New York City has been described as the cultural capital of the world. The culture of New York is reflected in its size and
         ethnic diversity. Many American cultural movements first emerged in the city. Large numbers of Irish, Italian, Jewish, and 
         ultimately Asian and Hispanic Americans also emigrated to New York throughout the 20th century, significantly influencing
          the culture and image of New York.</p>
    <h2>Tourist Attractions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Statue of Liberty, a gift from France to the United States, has welcomed new arrivals to the shores of America for over
             a hundred years. Lady Liberty on her pedestal stands at an impressive 93 meters.</li>
        <li>The iconic Empire State Building soars over a quarter of a mile above Manhattan and offers expansive views to the millions 
            of visitors it attracts every year. On a clear day, visitors can see New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and 
            Pennsylvania</li>
        <li>Located in the center of Manhattan, Central Park is a sprawling 840 acres and home to Belvedere Castle, the Central Park Zoo
             among many other attractions. For naturalists looking to take a break from the big city, relaxing in the Great Lawn or a walk
              along the extensive paths throughout the park can offer a much needed respite.</li>
