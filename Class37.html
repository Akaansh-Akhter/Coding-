            The history of chess can be traced back nearly 1500 years to its earliest known predecessor,
             called chaturanga, in India; its prehistory is the subject of speculation. From India it spread to
              Persia. Following the Arab invasion and conquest of Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim world 
              and subsequently spread to southern Europe. The game evolved roughly into its current form by about 1500 CE.
