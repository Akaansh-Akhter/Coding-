      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Swimming emerged as a competitive sport in the early 1800s in England. In 1828, the first indoor swimming pool, St George's
        Baths, was opened to the public. By 1837, the National Swimming Society was holding regular swimming competitions in six
        artificial swimming pools, built around London. The sport grew in popularity and by 1880, when the first national governing
        body, the Amateur Swimming Association, was formed, there were already over 300 regional clubs in operation across the
        country.</p>
