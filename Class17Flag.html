 <h1>The National Flag</h1>
 <img src="https://mybayutcdn.bayut.com/mybayut/wp-content/uploads/UAE-national-flag1-1024x640.jpg"height="500px">
 <p>The most important national symbol of any country is the flag. The UAE flag also known as the Emirati flag has an interesting 
     history of how it came to become one of the foremost national symbols of the UAE. After the federal union was formed in 1971 
     a flag designing competition was announced via the Al Ittihad newspaper. Over 1000 designs were submitted, from which only six
      was shortlisted. Eventually, the 4-colour flag we see today was chosen as the winner. It was designed by a young Emirati named 
      Abdullah Mohammad Al Maena whose designs were inspired by the poem on Arab Unity by Saifiul Deen Al Goll. He was awarded AED 4k
       for his design. Each of the colours used in the UAE flag was described in the poem: white for good deeds, green for fertile 
       plains, black for the darkness of battles and red for swords.</p>
