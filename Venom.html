        <h2>Reviews</h2>
        <p>
            Although the plot is pretty straightforward for a comic-book flick, the banter between Brock and Venom is often the film's most fascinating element. Brock is 
            constantly trying to quench Venom's thirst for, well, brains, leading to some amusing exchanges â€“ even if the humour won't necessarily satisfy everyone's taste. 
            Nevertheless, Tom Hardy's performance with the CGI character carries the film through some rough patches. Like Hardy, Woody Harrelson fully embraces the film's 
            quirky, often absurd tonality and certainly enjoys playing the antagonist. Together, they make some of the apparent plot holes easier to ignore.
